# Heffernan-Glossary
## How to update the glossary
All terms are stored in the JSON file. Updates on JSON file will update to the published webpage.
Add new terms in the same format. Example: 
```
{
    "term": "COI",
    "phrase": "Certificate of Insurance",
    "definition": "A document that provides evidence that an insurance policy is in place, outlining key policy information such as coverage, limits, and policyholder details."
}
```
or if the definition is empty:
```
{
    "term": "P/L",
    "phrase": "Personal Lines",
    "definition": ""
}
```
